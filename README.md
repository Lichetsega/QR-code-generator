I’ve just completed a small yet powerful project using Node.js that combines user input, QR code generation, and file handling.

🔍 Features:

User Input: Prompts the user to enter a URL using the inquirer package.
QR Code Generation: Uses the qr-image package to create a QR code from the entered URL.
File Handling: Saves the entered URL into a text file (URL.txt) and the generated QR code as an image (qr_img.png) using fs module.
This project is a great demonstration of how you can interact with users, generate content dynamically, and manage files seamlessly in Node.js. I look forward to building on this and incorporating more advanced features!
